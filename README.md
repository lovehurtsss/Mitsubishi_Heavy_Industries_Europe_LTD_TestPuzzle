# WPF_Test_Mitsubishi_Mordak

## Problem Description
 Imagine a bar chart where each bar has a width of 1 and is defined by a series of non-negative integers. The task is to determine how much water can be trapped after it rains.

### Example 1:
Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: The elevation map represented by the array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1] can trap 6 units of rainwater (represented by the blue section in the diagram).

### Example 2:
Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
Output: 9
Constraints:
n == height.length
1 <= n <= 2 * 10⁴
0 <= height[i] <= 10⁵
Project Structure
Main Application: The core logic to solve the rainwater trapping problem.
Documentation: Detailed explanations and usage examples.
